# Gauges
Automotive style gauge iOS custom controls

I have been working on creating an iOS application to calculate
the fuel level of my motorcycle. I was surprised that there
aren't some open source iOS controls to do this, so I'm creating
them. The fuel gauge will be first, since that is my personal
immediate need. But I'll be quickly following up with additional
gauges as shown below.


## FuelGauge

The FuelGauge is an automotive style fuel gauge.
It is packaged as an iOS framework that you can include in your
own projects as source code, or simply add it as a separate package.
It implements spring animations.

### Properties

* fuelLevel: Float (0.0 to 1.0)
